Extensions turn Spacedrive into a platform. Build custom tools for any workflow using Rust, compile to WASM, and integrate seamlessly with Spacedrive's sync, search, and storage infrastructure.

Extensions are not plugins that bolt onto the side. They're first-class applications built on Spacedrive's primitives. They get their own database tables, declare their own file storage locations, create AI agents with persistent memory, and appear indistinguishable from core features.

The extension system runs in a secure WASM sandbox with fine-grained permissions. Extensions can read and write files, create custom data models, run background jobs, and propose actions—all while staying isolated and safe.

## What You Can Build

Extensions can access Spacedrive's full capabilities. Define custom database tables that sync automatically. Create AI agents with unlimited memory. Run durable background jobs. Generate derivative sidecars. Propose file operations with user approval.

**Photos Extension:** Face recognition, place identification, automatic albums. Adds "People" to the sidebar, creates face cluster models, generates embedding sidecars.

**Email Archive:** IMAP sync to standard .eml files. The user picks where emails go. Spacedrive indexes them automatically. Extension queries via core search, enriches with analysis sidecars.

**Ledger:** Receipt OCR, expense tracking, tax prep. Extension creates Transaction models in its database, stores receipt PDFs as files, extracts data to sidecars.

The SDK handles sync, search, and indexing. You focus on your domain logic.

## Planned Extensions

Spacedrive's WASM-based extension system enables both professional tools and data archival capabilities. Extensions can share models and build on each other's data.
