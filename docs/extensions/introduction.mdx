## The Power of Extensibility

Spacedrive is designed to be a flexible and powerful platform for managing your personal data. While the core application provides a robust set of features for file management, synchronization, and organization, the true power of Spacedrive lies in its extensibility.

The **Spacedrive Developer SDK** allows developers to build first-class extensions that are indistinguishable from core functionality. Extensions can introduce new features, data models, and even AI-powered agents to create highly specialized and personalized experiences.

A sandboxed **WASM-based extension system** ensures that extensions run in a secure and isolated environment, while a comprehensive Rust SDK provides all the tools necessary to build powerful and efficient plugins.

## Why Build an Extension?

- **Solve Your Own Problems:** Create custom solutions for your unique workflows.
- **Share with the Community:** Publish your extensions on the Spacedrive Extension Store and share them with other users.
- **Integrate with Other Services:** Build extensions that connect Spacedrive to other services and platforms you use.
- **Contribute to the Ecosystem:** Help grow the Spacedrive ecosystem by creating new and innovative extensions.

## Planned Extensions

Spacedrive's WASM-based extension system enables both professional tools and data archival capabilities. Extensions can share models and build on each other's data.
