# Welcome to Spacedrive

Spacedrive is a cross-platform file manager. It connects your devices together to help you organize files from anywhere.

Beyond being an opinionated, swiss army knife file explorer, Spacedrive is a personal database. It identifies your files uniquely, understanding more file types than any operating system. 

Create photo albums that you'll never loose, effortlessly catalogue terabytes of video, move files between devices dynamically to optimize space and redundancy, generate preview media for easy viewing, automate security and encryption—the list goes on.

A decentralized, local-first design optimizes for privacy, security and data ownership—and best of all, its open source and entirely free.
