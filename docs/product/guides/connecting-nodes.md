# Connecting Nodes

::: slot note WIP 
It is not possible to connect Nodes yet, please check our [roadmap](/roadmap).

Nodes are instances of Spacedrive, commonly your devices. Currently Spacedrive supports Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS and Android. 

These devices can be connected via P2P to directly and securely synchronize and move data.
