# Roadmap

**Complete (Still Testing):**

- **File discovery** - Scan devices, drives and cloud accounts to build a directory of all files with metadata.
- **Preview generation** - Auto generate lower resolution stand-ins for image and video.
- **Statistics** - Total capacity, index size, preview media size, free space etc.

**In progress:**

- **File Explorer** - Browse online/offline storage locations, view files with metadata, perform basic CRUD.
- **Realtime synchronization** - Data index synchronized in realtime between devices, prioritizing peer-to-peer LAN connections (WiFi sync).
- **Self hosted** - Spacedrive can be deployed as a service, behaving as just another device powering your personal cloud.

**To be developed (MVP):**

- **Photos** - Photo and video albums similar to Apple/Google photos.
- **Search** - Deep search into your filesystem with a keybind, including offline locations.
- **Tags** - Define routines on custom tags to automate workflows, easily tag files individually, in bulk and automatically via rules.
- **Extensions** - Build tools on top of Spacedrive, extend functionality and integrate third party services. Extension directory on [spacedrive.com/extensions](/extensions).

**To be developed (Post-MVP):**

- **Spacedrive Cloud** - We'll host an always-on cloud device for you, with pay-as-you-go plans for storage.
- **Cloud integration** - Index & backup to Apple Photos, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive & Mega + easy API for the community to add more.
- **Encrypted vault(s)** - Effortlessly manage & encrypt sensitive files, built on top of VeraCrypt. Encrypt individual files or create flexible-size vaults.
- **Key manager** - View, mount, dismount and hide keys. Mounted keys automatically unlock respective areas of your filesystem.
- **Redundancy Goal** - Ensure a specific amount of copies exist for your important data, discover at-risk files and monitor device/drive health.
- **Timeline** - View a linear timeline of content, travel to any time and see media represented visually.
- **Media encoder** - Encode video and audio into various formats, use Tags to automate. Built with FFMPEG.
- **Workers** - Utilize the compute power of your devices in unison to encode and perform tasks at increased speeds.
