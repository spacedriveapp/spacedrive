# Extension Lineup Ideas for November 2025 Launch

**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025
**Goal:** Determine 3-5 alpha prototype extensions for November launch

## Recommended Launch Lineup

### Conservative (3 Extensions):
**Research + CRM + Vault**

**Why:**
- Research: Open source flagship, multi-industry, AI showcase
- CRM: Enterprise credibility, dogfooded ✓
- Vault: Universal appeal, obvious privacy fit

**Bundle:** Research + Vault = $15/mo (personal productivity)
**Separate:** CRM = $30/mo (enterprise)

**Positioning:** "Knowledge work + security essentials"

---

### Aggressive (4 Extensions):
**Research + CRM + Vault + Finance**

**Why:**
- Adds Finance for personal user appeal
- Shows breadth: knowledge work + security + finance
- Four different use cases prove platform versatility

**Bundle:** Research + Vault + Finance = $20/mo (power user)
**Separate:** CRM = $30/mo (enterprise)

**Positioning:** "Complete privacy-first productivity suite"

---

### Nuclear Option (5 Extensions):
**Research + CRM + Vault + Finance + Media Hub**

**Why:**

**Bundles:**

---

## Strategic Considerations

**Research as Open Source:**
- Drives adoption (students, academics, developers use free/cheap)
- Proves extensions can be open source AND paid
- Creates developer community around extensions
- Still generates revenue (not everyone will pirate)

**Why NOT Finance as lead:**
- You're right - seems random for file manager
- Better as #3 or #4 in lineup
- Keep it but don't lead with it in pitch

**Why CRM is mandatory:**
- You dogfood it (instant credibility)
- Enterprise positioning
- Shows dynamic data modeling

**Why Vault is perfect:**
- Everyone needs it
- Obvious privacy advantage
- Simple to explain

---

---

## Strategic Advantages of This Lineup

1. **Thematic consistency:** Every name feels like a subsystem (Research, Vault, Atlas, Ledger)
2. **"Data you already have":** Each extension processes existing files, not new data sources
3. **Multi-market appeal:** Knowledge work + security + finance + enterprise
4. **Open source proof:** Research proves paid open source extensions work
5. **Dogfooding credibility:** Atlas used internally
6. **Clear upgrade paths:** Personal → Work → Team bundles
7. **Demo diversity:** Each extension showcases different platform capabilities

---

## What NOT to Include (Keep in Core)

- Smart Archive / Backup (core platform feature)
- Cloud Connector (core platform feature)
- Document search (core platform feature)
- Basic photo management (core platform feature)
- File versioning (core platform feature)

Extensions should be about **processing and understanding data**, not **storing and organizing** (that's the core platform).

---

## Next Steps

1. Prototype all 4 extensions (Research, Vault, Atlas, Ledger)
2. Select best 3-4 based on implementation success
3. Update MEMO2.md with final lineup
4. Create demo script showing each extension's platform capabilities

**Recommendation:** Launch with all 4 if possible. Shows incredible execution velocity and platform breadth.
