Spacedrive unifies your files across all devices into one seamless experience. This guide walks you through initial setup and core concepts to get you organizing files in minutes.

You'll install Spacedrive, create your first library, and understand how the distributed filesystem works. By the end, you'll have a foundation for managing files across all your devices.

## Install Spacedrive

Spacedrive runs as a background service (daemon) with a separate user interface. This architecture enables features like offline sync and multi-device coordination.

<Steps>
<Step title="Download the App">
Visit [spacedrive.com/download](https://spacedrive.com/download) and get the installer for your platform. Spacedrive supports macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the Installer">
Follow your platform's standard installation process. On macOS, drag Spacedrive to Applications. On Windows, run the installer. Linux users can use AppImage or package managers.
</Step>
<Step title="Launch Spacedrive">
Open Spacedrive from your applications. The daemon starts automatically in the background. You'll see the setup wizard on first launch.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The daemon runs separately from the UI. Closing the app window doesn't stop file syncing or background operations. CLI users can set up auto-start with `sd daemon install` on macOS.
</Note>

## Create Your First Library

Libraries organize your files and settings. Think of a library as a unified view of all your data across devices.

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Library Name">
Pick a descriptive name like "Personal" or "Work". You can create multiple libraries later for different purposes.
</Step>
<Step title="Select Storage Location">
Spacedrive stores library data in a local database. Choose the default location or pick a custom path with sufficient space.
</Step>
<Step title="Complete Setup">
Click "Create Library" to initialize your database. Spacedrive creates the necessary structures for organizing your files.
</Step>
</Steps>

Your library starts empty. Next, you'll add locations to begin organizing files.

## Understand Key Concepts

Spacedrive introduces concepts that differ from traditional file managers:

### Libraries
A library is your personal database of file information. It stores:
- File metadata and organization
- Tags and custom attributes  
- Device relationships
- Sync settings

<Info>
Libraries remain local to each device but can sync organizational data between devices you own.
</Info>

### Locations
Locations are folders on your device that Spacedrive monitors. Adding a location indexes its contents into your library without moving files.

### Virtual Filesystem (VDFS)
Spacedrive creates a unified view of files across all devices. Files keep their physical location but appear in one searchable interface.

### SD Paths
Universal file addresses that work across all storage types. Spacedrive uses three types of paths:

- **Physical**: Traditional filesystem paths on local devices (`/Users/jane/Documents/report.pdf`)
- **Cloud**: Cloud storage paths for services like S3, Google Drive, or Dropbox (`photos/vacation/beach.jpg`)
- **Content**: Content-addressed paths that find files by their content, regardless of location

This unified system means you can copy files between your laptop, external drive, and cloud storage using the same commands.

## Navigate the Interface

The Spacedrive interface provides powerful tools for file management:

**Sidebar** - Switch between libraries, access locations, and view system status. Collapsible for more workspace.

**Explorer** - Browse files with list or grid views. Supports columns, sorting, and filtering like traditional file managers.

**Inspector** - View and edit file metadata. Add tags, see technical details, and manage file relationships.

**Search Bar** - Find files instantly across all indexed locations. Supports filters and advanced queries.

**Job Manager** - Monitor background operations like indexing and sync. Access via the status indicator.

<Tip>
Use keyboard shortcuts for efficiency. Press `⌘/` (Mac) or `Ctrl+/` (Windows/Linux) to see all available shortcuts.
</Tip>

## Add Your First Location

Connect a folder to start organizing files:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Location Settings">
Click the + button next to "Locations" in the sidebar or go to Settings → Locations.
</Step>
<Step title="Select a Folder">
Choose a folder to index. Start with something manageable like Documents or Pictures.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Indexing">
Select indexing depth:
- **Shallow**: File names and basic metadata only (fastest)
- **Deep**: Full content analysis including thumbnails (recommended)
</Step>
<Step title="Start Indexing">
Click "Add Location" to begin. Monitor progress in the job manager (status bar).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Initial indexing time depends on folder size and depth selected. A folder with 10,000 files typically takes 2-5 minutes for deep indexing.
</Warning>

## Organize with Tags

Tags provide flexible organization without moving files:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Tag">
Right-click any file and select "Add Tag" or use Settings → Tags to create tags first.
</Step>
<Step title="Apply Tags">
Select multiple files and apply tags in bulk. Tags sync across devices.
</Step>
<Step title="Filter by Tags">
Click tags in the sidebar to filter your view instantly.
</Step>
</Steps>

Tags support colors and hierarchies for advanced organization.

## Search Across Everything

Spacedrive's search works across all indexed locations simultaneously:

```
photo                    # Find all photos
tag:vacation            # Files tagged "vacation"  
size:>10MB              # Large files
modified:<7d            # Changed in last week
```

<Info>
Search runs locally for privacy. No file data leaves your devices.
</Info>

## Connect Another Device

Expand Spacedrive to multiple devices:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install on Second Device">
Download and install Spacedrive on another computer or mobile device.
</Step>
<Step title="Sign In">
Use the same account to link devices (coming soon) or set up peer-to-peer pairing.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Sync">
Choose which organizational data to sync. File content remains on original devices.
</Step>
</Steps>

Connected devices share tags, comments, and organization while keeping files in place.

## Troubleshooting

### Spacedrive won't start
- Check if the daemon is running in your system processes
- Restart your computer to clear any stuck processes
- Reinstall if issues persist

### Indexing seems slow
- Start with shallow indexing for large folders
- Ensure your disk isn't full
- Check job manager for detailed progress

### Can't see files
- Verify the location was added successfully
- Check if indexing completed in job manager
- Ensure you're viewing the correct library
