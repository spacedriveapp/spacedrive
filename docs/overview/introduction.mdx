<Warning>
**Code Open-Sourced: December 1, 2025**

This codebase is being released early for community testing and feedback. The first public release (2.0.0-pre.1) is coming before Christmas 2025.

spacedrive.com still shows v0.4.3. The new site launches with the release. Until then, these docs are your primary resource.

## What is Spacedrive?

Spacedrive is a local-first file manager that unifies data across devices without centralized cloud services. Files stay where they are. Spacedrive creates a content-aware index that makes them searchable, syncable, and manageable from anywhere.

## Why Spacedrive Exists

Computing was designed for single devices. File managers like Finder and Explorer assume your data lives on the computer in front of you. The shift to multi-device forced us into cloud ecosystems. Convenience required giving up data ownership.

AI is accelerating this trend. Cloud services offer semantic search and intelligent analysis, but only if you upload your files to their infrastructure. Spacedrive is building the architecture for local AI on hardware you already own, on data that never leaves your control.

This is infrastructure for the next era of computing.

## Current State

### What Works Now (December 2025)

**MacOS (Primary Testing Platform)**
- Tauri desktop app with working interface
- File indexing and analysis (OCR, transcriptions, thumbnails)
- Multi-device library sync
- Content identity and deduplication
- CLI for daemon management

**Windows & Linux (Community Testing)**
- Everything should work theoretically
- Not fully tested yet, bugs expected
- Help us validate cross-platform support

**CLI**
- Full library management
- Daemon control
- Best way to test core functionality

### Coming in 2.0.0-pre.1 (Before Christmas)

- Mobile app (React Native)
- Spacedrive Cloud deployment
- Extension SDK (stable)
- AI integration (local models)
- File sync (currently library sync only)
- New spacedrive.com

### Prototypes (Not Public)

Native Swift apps (iOS, macOS) and a GPUI media viewer exist as private prototypes. These demonstrate type-safe native integration and platform-specific optimizations. They may become production apps if performance demands it.

## How It Works

Spacedrive treats files as first-class objects with content identity. A photo on your laptop and the same photo on your NAS are recognized as one piece of content.

**Core capabilities:**
- Search millions of files in under 100ms
- Preview operations before execution (conflicts, space savings, outcomes)
- Sync peer-to-peer without servers or consensus protocols
- Track redundancy across devices
- Full offline functionality

Files stay in place. Spacedrive makes them universally addressable with rich metadata.

## Testing & Feedback

This testing period is important. We need community help validating:
- Cross-platform compatibility (especially Windows/Linux)
- v1 to v2 library migration
- Multi-device sync scenarios
- Performance at scale

Current v0.4.3 users will migrate when 2.0.0-pre.1 releases. Your testing helps ensure that transition is smooth.

<Tip>
MacOS users: Focus on testing indexing, multi-device sync, and the interface. Windows/Linux users: Report any bugs you encounter. All feedback is valuable.
</Tip>

## For Developers

<Warning>
**Most architecture docs are in the Developer section.** The core technical documentation lives under [Architecture](/core/architecture), not in overview guides.
</Warning>

Key technical docs:
- [Architecture Overview](/core/architecture) - System design and principles
- [Data Model](/core/data-model) - How data is structured
- [Content Addressing](/core/addressing) - Content identity system
- [Library Sync](/core/library-sync) - Multi-device synchronization
- [Testing Guide](/core/testing) - Test framework and patterns

## Roadmap

The `.tasks` folder in the repo tracks core development work. The new landing page (releasing with 2.0.0-pre.1) will have a public roadmap. For now, `.tasks` and these docs are the best reference.

<Info>
Some guides are written as if features are complete. This is intentional—they document the release state, not current state. When features aren't ready yet, you'll see callouts like this.

## Project Timeline

Spacedrive v2 development began in June 2025. This is a ground-up rewrite addressing lessons from the v1 alpha. The architecture is designed for long-term sustainability, not quick feature delivery.

Six months later, the core is stable enough for community testing. The Christmas release will be feature-complete for the advertised capabilities.
