Libraries in Spacedrive organize your digital life into separate, manageable collections. Create libraries for different purposes, sync settings between devices, and maintain clean separation between personal and work files.

This guide explains library management from basic operations to advanced multi-library workflows.

## Understand Libraries

A library is your personal file database containing:
- Indexed file metadata and thumbnails
- Tags, comments, and custom organization  
- Location mappings and folder relationships
- Device pairings and sync settings
- Job history and statistics

<Info>
Libraries exist independently. Files in one library remain completely separate from others, ensuring privacy and organization.
</Info>

## Create Additional Libraries

Beyond your first library, create specialized collections:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Library Switcher">
Click the library name in the top bar or press `⌘L` (Mac) / `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux).
</Step>
<Step title="Select Create Library">
Choose "Create New Library" from the dropdown menu.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Library">
Name your library and optionally:
- Set custom storage location
- Choose encryption settings
- Configure default indexing rules
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize Library">
Click "Create" to build the database structure. Spacedrive switches to the new library automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Each library maintains its own database file. Default location: `~/Library/Application Support/spacedrive/libraries/` on macOS.
</Note>

## Switch Between Libraries

Navigate multiple libraries efficiently:

### Quick Switch
Press `⌘L` / `Ctrl+L` to open the library switcher. Recent libraries appear at top.

### Keyboard Navigation  
Use number keys `1-9` to switch to libraries by position in the list.

### Set Default Library
Right-click a library in the switcher and select "Set as Default". This library opens on app launch.

<Tip>
Pin frequently used libraries to the top of the switcher for faster access.
</Tip>

## Library Settings

Customize each library independently:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Library Settings">
Navigate to Settings → Library or press `⌘,` / `Ctrl+,` then select Library tab.
</Step>
<Step title="General Settings">
Configure basic options:
- **Name**: Update library display name
- **Description**: Add notes about library purpose
- **Storage Path**: View database location
- **Statistics**: See total files, size, and devices
</Step>
<Step title="Privacy Settings">
Control library privacy:
- **Encryption**: Enable database encryption
- **Network Visibility**: Hide from network discovery
- **Sync Permissions**: Limit which devices can sync
</Step>
<Step title="Advanced Options">
Fine-tune behavior:
- **Indexing Rules**: Default settings for new locations
- **Thumbnail Quality**: Balance quality vs storage
- **Job Concurrency**: Parallel processing limits
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Library Patterns

### Work/Personal Separation

Create distinct libraries for different aspects of life:

**Work Library**
- Project files and documents
- Client assets  
- Meeting recordings
- Professional photos

**Personal Library**  
- Family photos and videos
- Personal documents
- Entertainment media
- Hobby projects

<Warning>
Libraries cannot share files directly. Use separate locations if you need files accessible from multiple libraries.
</Warning>

### Project-Based Libraries

Organize major projects independently:

```
Film Project Library
├── Raw Footage (Location)
├── Audio Files (Location)  
├── Project Files (Location)
└── Exports (Location)
```

Benefits:
- Archive entire project when complete
- Share library with collaborators
- Prevent accidental cross-contamination

### Device-Specific Libraries

Optimize for different device types:

**Mobile Library** - Lightweight for phones/tablets
- Photos and screenshots only
- Minimal processing rules
- Reduced thumbnail sizes

**Desktop Library** - Full features for computers
- All file types indexed
- Maximum quality thumbnails  
- Advanced processing enabled

## Sync Libraries Between Devices

Share organizational data across your devices:

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Library Sync">
In Library Settings, toggle "Enable Sync" and note the Library ID displayed.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Library on Second Device">
On another device, choose "Join Existing Library" and enter the Library ID.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Connection">
Confirm device pairing using the security code shown on both screens.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Sync Options">
Choose what syncs:
- **Metadata Only**: Tags, comments (default)
- **Organization**: Folder structures  
- **Settings**: Library preferences
- **Locations**: Folder mappings (advanced)
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Sync only shares organizational data. Actual files remain on their original devices unless explicitly transferred.
</Info>

### Sync Behavior

Understanding sync helps avoid confusion:

**Immediate Sync**
- Tags and labels
- File relationships
- Custom metadata

**Device-Specific**  
- Location paths
- Indexing progress
- Local preferences

**Never Synced**
- Actual file contents
- Temporary data
- Job history

## Back Up Libraries

Protect your organizational work:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate Library Database">
Find your library file:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/spacedrive/libraries/[id]/library.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\spacedrive\libraries\[id]\library.db`
- Linux: `~/.config/spacedrive/libraries/[id]/library.db`
</Step>
<Step title="Create Backup">
Copy the entire library folder to backup location. Include all `.db` files and thumbnails directory.
</Step>
<Step title="Automate Backups">
Set up automated backups using:
- Time Machine (macOS)
- File History (Windows)  
- rsync scripts (Linux)
- Cloud backup services
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Name backup files with date stamps: `library-personal-2024-01-15.db`
</Tip>

## Restore Libraries

Recover from backups when needed:

<Steps>
<Step title="Close Spacedrive">
Quit the app completely. Ensure daemon stops.
</Step>
<Step title="Replace Library Files">
Copy backup files to the library directory, overwriting existing files.
</Step>
<Step title="Restart Spacedrive">
Launch app. The restored library appears in the switcher.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Restoration">
Check recent files and tags to confirm successful restore.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Delete Libraries

Remove unwanted libraries cleanly:

<Steps>
<Step title="Switch to Different Library">
Ensure you're not currently using the library to delete.
</Step>
<Step title="Open Library Manager">
Access via Settings → Libraries → Manage.
</Step>
<Step title="Select Library">
Choose the library and click "Delete Library".
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Deletion">
Type the library name to confirm. This permanently removes:
- Database files
- Thumbnails
- Organizational data
- Sync relationships
</Step>
</Steps>

<Danger>
Library deletion cannot be undone. Back up important libraries before deleting.
</Danger>

## Troubleshooting

### Library won't open
- Check disk space for database
- Verify file permissions
- Try recovery mode (hold Shift on launch)
- Restore from backup if corrupted

### Sync not working
- Confirm both devices online
- Check Library IDs match
- Verify network connectivity
- Re-pair devices if needed

### Performance issues
- Reduce thumbnail quality
- Limit concurrent jobs
- Archive old data
- Split large libraries

### Missing locations
- Locations are device-specific
- Re-add locations after sync
- Check paths still exist
- Verify permissions

## Advanced Library Management

### Library Templates

Create template libraries for repeated setups:

```
Photo Workshop Template
├── RAW Import (Location preset)
├── Working Files (Location preset)
├── Client Delivery (Location preset)
└── Archive (Location preset)
```

Export and import library configurations without data.

### Multi-User Libraries

Share libraries safely:

**Read-Only Access** - Others can view but not modify
**Contributor Access** - Add files and tags
**Admin Access** - Full control including settings

<Note>
Multi-user features require Spacedrive Cloud (coming soon) or self-hosted server.
</Note>

### Library Analytics

Monitor library usage:

- File type distribution
- Growth over time
- Most active locations
- Tag usage patterns
- Device contribution

Access analytics in Settings → Library → Statistics.

## Best Practices

**Name Clearly**: Use descriptive names indicating purpose or content type.

**Regular Backups**: Automate weekly backups of important libraries.

**Prune Regularly**: Remove unused locations and clean up old jobs.

**Document Purpose**: Add descriptions explaining library organization.

**Test Sync**: Verify sync works before relying on it.

Your libraries now provide organized, separate spaces for different aspects of your digital life. Each library maintains its independence while enabling powerful organization features.
