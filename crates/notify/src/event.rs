    // the size of an L1 cache line. The entire kind classification fits in 3 bytes, and an AnyMap
    // is 3 pointers. A Vec<PathBuf> is another 3 pointers.

    // get, while retrieving anything in the AnyMap requires some accesses as overhead.

    // should go in the attrs. Additionally, arbitrary data can _only_ go in the attrs.
