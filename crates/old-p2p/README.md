# Spacedrive's P2P Crate

## Functionality

This crate handles low-level P2P networking and the transferring of data between machines across a network.

## Credits

We'd like to give credit towards both the `libp2p` developers/maintainers, as well as the [Syncthing BEP Protocol](https://docs.syncthing.net/specs/bep-v1.html)'s designers, developers and maintainers - our implementation was heavily inspired by the protocol and made our lives a lot easier. Thank you!
