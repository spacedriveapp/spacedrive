## Description

Design the infrastructure for provisioning and running isolated `sd-core` instances for users in a cloud environment. This involves creating a scalable and secure architecture, likely using containerization and orchestration technologies like Kubernetes.

## Implementation Steps

1.  Research and select the appropriate cloud technologies (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker, serverless functions).
2.  Design the architecture for multi-tenant isolation of user cores.
3.  Define the provisioning and de-provisioning lifecycle for user cores.
4.  Specify the security and networking policies for the cloud environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A detailed architecture document is created.
- [ ] The design addresses scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness.
- [ ] The design is approved and ready for implementation.
