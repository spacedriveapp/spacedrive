## Description

Design the detailed protocol for Library Sync. This includes defining the communication flow between peers, the format of the messages, and the logic for initiating and managing a sync session.

## Implementation Steps

1.  Define the state machine for a sync session (e.g., negotiation, metadata exchange, file operations, completion).
2.  Specify the protocol messages for each stage of the sync process.
3.  Design the error handling and recovery mechanisms.
4.  Create a sequence diagram to illustrate the protocol flow.

## Acceptance Criteria
-   [ ] A detailed protocol design document is created.
-   [ ] The protocol addresses all aspects of the Library Sync model.
-   [ ] The design is approved and ready for implementation.
